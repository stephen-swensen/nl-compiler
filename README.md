# nl-compiler
NL is a statically typed programming language targeting .NET.

The compiler is written in F# using FsLex and FsYacc for lexing and parsing, and SRE for CIL emission.

It is a hobby project used by the author as a first exploration of programming language design and compiler implementation.
